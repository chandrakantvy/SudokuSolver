## Simple GUI for sudoku game.

so I haven't uploaded any "sudoku.csv" file which is used in code because
it was a huge file of 9 million sudoku puzzle.

## You will get the sudoku.csv file at:
https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/sudoku

* sudokuSolution.py is just python script to solve a sudoku using backtracking.
* It has nothing to do with GUI file.
